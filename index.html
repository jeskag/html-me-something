    <h2>Cruise Life&reg;</h2>
        <p>In a short month, my husband and I will embark on our fifth cruise and 
           this time bringing along family to share this addiction with.  As we prepare
           for this trip, it gives us a chance to reflect back on the first cruise for us
           as it will be the exact same itenerary.</p>
        
        <p>It all started in 2012, where we boarded the Carnival Conquest for 7 days of
            fun.  The itenerary included:
            <ul id="Ports">
                <li>Port 1:  Roatan, Honduras</li>
                <li>Port 2:  Belize City, Belize</li>
                <li>Port 3:  Cozumel, Mexico</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Roatan, Honduras</h3>

        <p class = "Roatan"> As we stepped off the ship, we headed to our tour which would be a
            snorkeling catamaran.  We stepped on the catamaran and sailed to our
            destination.  Once at our destination, we put on our snorkel gear and hopped
            into the water.  The water was beautiful and like a pool.  After putting my head
            in the water, I saw the most beautiful fish and coral that I've ever seen.  
            Unfortunately, after about an hour, a tropical system was coming in and we had to 
            head back quickly to get to the boat.</p>

        <h3>Belize City, Belize</h3>

        <p id = "Belize">Belize is a tender port so we had to be taken into land by boat.  After we arrived
           on land, we didn't have an excursion booked at this point.  We were walking through
           port and met a nice gentleman who told us to go talk to "Rice" and he would take
           care of us.  Belize is not known for being very safe so we were reluctant, however,
           we found Rice and decided on a tour with him.  He took us in a small car (there were
           4 of us) to the Belize Zoo.  Seeing the country makes me even more happy to live in the
           USA.  The animals were neat and Rice was going to take us shopping where the locals
           go, however, we had to get back to the ship.</p>

        <h3>Cozumel, Mexico</h3>

        <p>We booked another excursion through the cruise line so after we stepped off the
           ship, we went to find our group.  After everyone gathered, we headed to Chankanaab
           Park which we would have another fun-filled day of snorkeling, beach, and fufilling
           a life-long dream of swimming with dolphins.  Swimming with dolphins was everything
           and more than I hoped it would be.  After several hours, we headed back to the ship.</p>

        <p>Leaving the ship on the last day was the hardest part.  I had been bitten by
           the cruise bug.  Since then, we try to cruise at least once, if not twice, a
           year.  Now time for the next generation...</p>
